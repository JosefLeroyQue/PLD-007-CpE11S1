Exercise 1: Counter- Controlled Repetition. A class of ten students took a quiz. The grades (integers in the range of 0 to 100) for this quiz are available to you. Determine the class average on the quiz. Use c++.

 

Using the following pseudocode the program can be as follows:

Set total to zero

Set grade counter to one

While grade counter is less than or equal to ten

Input the next grade

Add the grade into the total

Add one to the grade counter

Set the class average to the total divided by ten

Print the class average
